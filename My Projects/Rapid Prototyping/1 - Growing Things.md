## Overview

From June 30th to July 13th.
On the theme of the same name.
Made on Unreal.

**Game Designer:** VERDIER Baptiste
**Programmer:** Sky's

**Personal Goal:** See the time it takes to create a prototype for the next ones.

## Organisation

We divided the work in 2 parts:
- 1 week for the game design
- Then 1 week for the programming

Here is the Game Design Document:
[[Growing Things - Game Design Document]]

##### What was my workflow
1. Read and Understand what was asked of me.
2. I started by making the movement of the character by taking the base Unreal mannequin.
3. Then I started to work on the base of an interaction system, the game being based mostly on it.
4. The tiles where mostly easy to create since it was just a creation of an actor.
5. The hotbar creation followed to start working on the different types of interaction based on objects.
6. To move around the tiles and to help the player understand the mechanic, I implemented ladders if the new tile created was on top or bellow the player and an hologram to tell the player that he can place a tile at places.
7. I continued by creating the plants that can be watered to grow and finally be harvested for more seeds and fruits.
8. I finalised by finishing the hotbar system to add / remove items when gained / used via automations.

My mindset was to start with solid foundations to create on top of it. Like on the normal projects.

## What did I learn

1. I started this project on holydays, so I learned that I couldn't be when I want on the project since I moved a lot during the week.
2. My approach of Foundations first, Creation second was flawed since it took me too much time to create these foundations.
3. The Hotbar system is too much work and need to be simplified.
4. I spent too much time debugging the holograms and hotbar, next time, if it don't break the game, no need to fix it.
5. Having better materials would be great because good visuals are always a pluss.

Next project on unreal should have a level.
